A demo of Elastic Weight Consolidation for Lifelong Learning on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10

### ðŸ§  Why Lifelong Learning Matters
Traditional neural networks forget previous knowledge when trained on new tasks (catastrophic forgetting). **Lifelong learning** aims to retain old knowledge while learning new tasks, making AI systems more adaptive and intelligent.

This project demonstrates **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** as a solution for catastrophic forgetting using a simple neural network model.
